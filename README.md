# NBA Spurs team Regression Project: Overview

- Collected Spurs Stats data from the years 1998 - 2014
- Visualized the stats of some of Spurs best years to compare their effectiveness.
- Used different Machine Learning Algorithm to predict whether defensive stats make an impact in Game winning.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Explored how age effects rebounding which I later learned that height is a big factor.
- According to the Correlation plot, if we look at the rebounds, blocks, and steals we can see that the spurs team had a really strong defensive team.
- The correlations plot also shows us how both defensive rebounds and steals impacts points scored.
